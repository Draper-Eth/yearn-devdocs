Holds an underlying token, and allows users to interact with the Yearn ecosystem through Strategies connected to the Vault. Vaults are not limited to a single Strategy, they can have as many Strategies as can be designed (however the withdrawal queue is capped at 20.) Deposited funds are moved into the most impactful strategy that has not already reached its limit for assets under management, regardless of which Strategy a user's funds end up in, they receive their portion of yields generated across all Strategies. When a user withdraws, if there are no funds sitting undeployed in the Vault, the Vault withdraws funds from Strategies in the order of least impact. (Funds are taken from the Strategy that will disturb everyone's gains the least, then the next least, etc.) In order to achieve this, the withdrawal queue's order must be properly set and managed by the community (through governance). Vault Strategies are parameterized to pursue the highest risk-adjusted yield. There is an \"Emergency Shutdown\" mode. When the Vault is put into emergency shutdown, assets will be recalled from the Strategies as quickly as is practical (given on-chain conditions), minimizing loss. Deposits are halted, new Strategies may not be added, and each Strategy exits with the minimum possible damage to position, while opening up deposits to be withdrawn by users. There are no restrictions on withdrawals above what is expected under Normal Operation.
