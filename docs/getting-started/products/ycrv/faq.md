## Launch and Migration

### When will yCRV launch?
TBD - no date set yet. All contracts are live, but due to how rewards work, some coordination is required to ensure all users are migrated without missing rewards.

### Should I migrate now?
No. Wait until migration date, when incentives move to the new sysetem otherwise you will not have exposure to them.

### What happens to yveCRV and yvBOOST?
yveCRV and yvBOOST are being deprecated, and there is a migratin path available to users. yCRV can be minted 1:1 from yveCRV. yCRV can be minted 1 * pricePerShare of yvBOOST at time of migration. There will be a migration zap available to all users to make this easy.

### Will I get rewards if I don't migrate?
No. After the cut-over date, all incentives will move to the new yCRV system.

### Is there a deadline for migration?
Nope! You can migrate anytime into the future. Contracts are trustless and migrations cannot stopped.
